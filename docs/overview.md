The website will be a single landing page with the following sections:

- **Hero Section:** A compelling headline, a brief value proposition, and a prominent Call-to-Action (CTA) button to enroll.
- **Course Modules:** An overview of the key topics and skills taught in the course. This section should be interactive, allowing users to see more details for each module.
- **Testimonials:** Social proof from previous students to build trust and credibility.
- **Pricing / Enrollment:** A clear, simple pricing structure and a final, strong CTA to enroll in the course.
- **Footer:** Basic navigation and social links.

## 4. Tone and Branding
